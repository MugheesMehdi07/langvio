## What is Langvio?

Langvio bridges the gap between human language and computer vision. Ask questions about images and videos in plain English, and get intelligent analysis powered by state-of-the-art vision models and language models.

```python
import langvio

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = langvio.create_pipeline()

# Ask a question about your image
result = pipeline.process(
    query="How many people are wearing red shirts?",
    media_path="street_scene.jpg"
)

print(result['explanation'])
# Output: "I found 3 people wearing red shirts in the image..."
```

## Key Features

## Quick Example

=== "Image Analysis"

    ```python
    import langvio
    
    pipeline = langvio.create_pipeline()
    
    # Basic object detection
    result = pipeline.process(
        "What objects are in this image?",
        "scene.jpg"
    )
    ```

=== "Object Counting"

    ```python
    import langvio
    
    pipeline = langvio.create_pipeline()
    
    # Count specific objects
    result = pipeline.process(
        "Count all the cars in the parking lot",
        "parking_lot.jpg"
    )
    ```

=== "Video Analysis"

    ```python
    import langvio
    
    pipeline = langvio.create_pipeline()
    
    # Analyze video content
    result = pipeline.process(
        "How many people crossed the street?",
        "traffic_video.mp4"
    )
    ```

=== "Attribute Detection"

    ```python
    import langvio
    
    pipeline = langvio.create_pipeline()
    
    # Find objects by attributes
    result = pipeline.process(
        "Find all red objects in this scene",
        "colorful_scene.jpg"
    )
    ```
